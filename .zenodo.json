  "description": "<p>Program to  calculate Protein Stability Index from the sequence. ML models were developed based on experimental stability datasets for a 24/23-mer covering the N-/C-terminus of the human proteome using the CatBoost regressor. The performance of the final models was evaluated using the testing set and an R2 coefficient, reaching the values of 0.796/0.812 for the N-terminus with initiator methionine cleaved/not cleaved, respectively, and 0.815 for the C-terminus (the highest possible value of R2 coefficient is 1). See the paper for details and the <a href=\"https://degronopedia.com/degronopedia/tutorial#ML\">degronopedia tutorial</a>) for more information.</p>",
